Enhancing Pulmonary Disease Diagnosis with AI (Including COVID-19)
Brief description:

A project combining artificial intelligence and medical imaging to diagnose lung diseases, including COVID-19, using convolutional neural networks (CNN)

Objective:
Develop an AI model to analyze chest X-rays and improve diagnostic accuracy

Techniques:

Image preprocessing (histogram equalization).
Development and training of a CNN based on the COVID-QU database (15,000 images).
Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC curve)

Results:

High-performing model after 20 training epochs.
Potential application for faster and more accurate diagnoses

SKILLS
Machine learning and deep learning.
Use of medical databases (COVID-QU).
CNN model design.
Advanced metrics for model evaluation

Tools and technologies used:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Medical image processing (preprocessing).
